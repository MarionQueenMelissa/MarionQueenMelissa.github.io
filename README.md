# Problems and Bugs
Here are the problems and bugs that I plan to address in the future. If you fixed them, please do not hesitate to send me a pull request, and I would be very grateful. Please also report problems and bugs in [GitHub Issues](https://marionqueenmelissa.github.io/).

- On mobile Safari, the menu on the top will not close after opening it. This is because the menu icon on mobile Safari retains focus after a touch event, and the menu relies on the loss of focus event of the icon to close.

# Future Plans for Feature Enhancement
Here are several features that I plan to add in the future. If you wish to contribute, please email me to discuss the design before submitting pull requests.

- Provision of instant notification to the users once there are issues with the
  application and in that, we shall be able to get the feedback thus fixing the
  problem as soon as possible.
- Connection of users to their mobile money account and bank account such
  that their expenses are subtracted directly from their account.
